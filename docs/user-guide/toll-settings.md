# Toll Settings

The **Toll Settings** section controls how much another user must pay to send you a message or payment in Liberdus. This feature helps manage spam and ensures fair network participation.

## How Message Tolls Work

Each user can define a **toll amount**, a small fee required from the sender to initiate communication with you.  
The toll can be set to zero for open communication or adjusted higher for increased filtering or compensation.

## Current Toll Amount

Your **current toll amount** represents the cost in USD (and its LIB equivalent) that others must pay to message or transact with you.

**Example:**
Current Toll: 0.600000 USD (≈ 75.000000 LIB)

This means that senders must pay **0.60 USD**, converted automatically to the corresponding **LIB** value at the current market rate.

## Setting a New Toll Amount

You can update your toll at any time from the **Toll Settings** panel.

### To Update the Toll:

1. Go to **Settings → Toll**.  
2. Locate the **Set New Toll Amount** section.  
3. Enter the new toll value in **USD**.  
4. Click **Save Changes** to apply the change.

> Liberdus automatically converts the USD value to LIB at the current exchange rate.

## Configuration Rules

- **Set to 0 USD** → disables the toll (open communication).  
- **Set above 0 USD** → requires senders to pay before messaging.  
- **Minimum toll:** `0.2000 USD`.

> The entered toll must be **greater than or equal to** the minimum threshold. Attempting to set a lower amount will result in an error.
