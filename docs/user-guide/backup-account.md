# Backup Account

Liberdus allows you to back up and restore your account data across devices and platforms. Backups are encrypted and portable, enabling secure migration without losing messages, keys, or settings.


A backup file contains your Liberdus account data, including keys, contacts, and preferences.  
You can use this file to restore your account on another device or browser instance.

> **Note:** The backup file is encrypted. Keep it safe and do not share it with anyone.

## Creating a Backup

You can create a backup from **any Liberdus platform** (web or mobile).

1. Open **Settings → Backup**.  
2. Choose the option **Backup all accounts**.
3. Enter your account password and click on **Download Data** button.
4. Liberdus generates a `.json` file and downloads it to your device.

> Store your backup file securely (for example, in encrypted cloud storage or an external drive).

## Account Migration

You can restore your account from any Liberdus platform.

1. Open Liberdus on the new device or browser.  
2. Go to **Menu → Restore**.  
3. Select the previously saved `.json` file and enter your account password.
4. Click on **Load Account** & your account will be restored automatically.

> The restoration process overwrites existing local data. Make sure to back up before importing.
